Echoes of Wisdom is a 2024 action-adventure game on the Nintendo Switch. The game's central mechanic involves spawning creatures and objects—"echoes"—to solve puzzles and beat enemies. I had a blast playing Echoes of Wisdom, but the menu for selecting which echo to use was a definite sticking point. Throughout your quest you can collect up to 127 echoes, and the main method of using one is by finding it in a one-dimensional list. You may sort by “Type” and “Most Recently Used” which helps, but I believe other options could provide a better experience and match the high bar of polish set by the rest of the game. Exploring alternatives in this project was immensely satisfying.

I implemented these prototypes using TypeScript and React. This project was inspired by the fantastic video by Game Maker's Toolkit, who built many of these prototypes in Unity: [Can I fix Zelda's UI using Unity?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4vsgC41bYg)
